## About The Project

This is a GitHub repository for a research project that explores the association between precipitation, drought, and presence and density of livestock on human enteric illness in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. All data, except human case data, are available via this compendium. Instructions for collecting data, as well as code for merging and linking data are available to help others reproduce the results and conduct this work in other areas. Although surveillance data in this analysis are not considered protected health information, health data require a data use agreement with each individual state health department in order to gain access. Please contact the lead author for further guidance: Erika Austhof, [barrette\@arizona.edu](mailto:barrette@arizona.edu)
